# How to use
1. Download the ZIP or just `git clone` it. It should have all this file and folders.

2. Paste your `.mirror` folder at your desired path. (It should have 19.7 GB of file size. Check the pic below.)

# Requirement
Scripts require standard-library Python 3.11 or newer. The bundled Python path
in the commands above is specific to the original PC; the portable ZIP instead
provides `runtime\python.exe` and the double-click launcher.
Completed files and `.part` transfers are retained for resumption. Final checks
cover inventory sizes, runtime hash samples, WASM signature, HTTP isolation,
range reads and both batch formats. Actual gameplay requires separate browser
validation. A public client snapshot is not the site's original development repository.

To resume with the current uncapped settings, append `--workers 32 --rate-mib 0`
to the downloader command. Content lengths from HTTP take precedence over the
source manifest when it is stale; mismatches are recorded explicitly.
